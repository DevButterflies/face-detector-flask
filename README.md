# Face Detection using MTCNN, SSD, OpenCV, and DeepFace

This repository provides a simple web application for **face detection** using **MTCNN**, **SSD**, and **OpenCV** models, with **DeepFace** as the input handler. The application is built using **Flask** and outputs cropped face images based on the input image.

## Features

- **Face Detection** using multiple models: **MTCNN**, **SSD**, and **OpenCV**.
- **DeepFace Integration**: Easily use DeepFace to handle image preprocessing.
- **Web Interface** built with **Flask** for easy image upload and processing.
- **Cropped Face Output**: The application returns the image with detected faces cropped out.

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
